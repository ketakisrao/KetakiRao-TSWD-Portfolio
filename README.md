# Storytelling With Data

Welcome to my online portfolio for the Storytelling with Data class.

# About Me

I am a student from the Master of Human Computer Interaction program at School of Computer Science, Carnegie Mellon. I enjoy working working with data sets and like to build viusalisations on them to be able to showcase what the data is about and what one needs to know from it. I've worked on a very diverse range of datasets, from MSF(Doctors without Borders) data to a dataset that I made based on Cheeses. One of my favourite viusalisation is [Napoleonâ€™s invasion of Russia](https://miro.medium.com/max/4006/1*V9sq--wHI1wm1zA3Gng1sg.png). Here is a link to my favourite [charting library](https://www.amcharts.com/).

Some of my previous works are:
* [Met Museum](https://ketakisrao.github.io/Met/)
* [Say Cheese](https://ketakisrao.github.io/CMUPortfolio/saycheese.html)

# What I hope to learn?

I want to be able to learn how to creatively & effectively show data that looks boring in tables and is also not very readable/comparable. I want to know the role of color, size, typography, etc in making a visualization effective or ineffective(on thing that I've learned being in a design program is that knowing what not to is as important as knowing what to do). I want to understand how testing can play a role in improving data visualizations and how I can extend my HCI knowledge to make  visualisations compelling and easy to understand.
